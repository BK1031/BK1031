## Hey there, I'm Bharat!

I am a junior at the University of California, Santa Barbara who enjoys developing applications and tools using computer science to solve real-life problems. Most of my experience is in full-stack mobile development using a variety of languages. I also love robotics and exploring the intersection of computer science and electrical engineering. I'm always on the lookout for new tools and technologies, and you can check out my website to see what I'm currently working on.
